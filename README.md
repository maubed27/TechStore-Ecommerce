Body: {"deliveryAddress": "123 Main St, Anytown, State, 12345"} (Frontend prompts for this)

8. Key Learnings & Troubleshooting
This project involved navigating several common and complex challenges in Java web development, providing valuable learning experiences:

Java EE vs. Jakarta EE Migration: Initial ClassCastException errors due to javax.servlet vs. jakarta.servlet namespace conflicts when using JDK 9+ and Tomcat 9.

Solution: Updated pom.xml to javax.servlet-api (Servlet 4.0 / Java EE 8) and ensured all Java imports explicitly used javax.servlet.*. Corrected Eclipse Project Facets to align with Dynamic Web Module 4.0.

Java Module System (JPMS) Reflection Issues: InaccessibleObjectException when Gson tried to reflectively access java.time.LocalDateTime fields in JDK 9+.

Solution: Implemented and registered a custom Gson LocalDateTimeAdapter in init() methods of all servlets that serialize/deserialize objects containing LocalDateTime fields (e.g., Product, Order).

Session Object Serialization: Cannot deserialize session attribute warnings/errors.

Solution: Ensured all custom model classes (Product, CartItem, User, Order, OrderItem) implemented java.io.Serializable.

MySQL Safe Update Mode (Error Code 1175): Preventing DELETE without WHERE clause.

Solution: Temporarily disabled SQL_SAFE_UPDATES via SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; in the MySQL client session before executing DELETE FROM products;.

Image Hotlinking Prevention: External product images not loading.

Solution: Downloaded product images and hosted them locally within src/main/webapp/images/, updating MySQL database paths to point to these local resources.

Debugging Empty/Malformed JSON Responses: Persistent Unexpected end of JSON input errors.

Solution: Employed extensive java.util.logging.Logger statements in servlets and DAOs to trace execution flow and identify exact points of failure. Used browser Developer Tools' Network tab to inspect raw server responses. Ensured PrintWriter was correctly used and flushed, and that sendErrorResponse only sent valid JSON.

Eclipse Project Management: Frequent Maven > Update Project... (with Force Update), Project > Clean..., and Tomcat server restarts were essential for synchronizing changes and resolving build path issues.

9. Future Enhancements
This project provides a solid foundation. Here are some ideas for further development:

Admin Panel: Create a dedicated web interface for administrators to manage products (add, edit, delete), view all orders, and manage users.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with a real (or simulated) payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for actual transaction processing.

Advanced Product Filtering: Implement more complex filters (e.g., by price range, stock availability, brand) and sorting options.

Search Optimization: Implement full-text search capabilities in the database for products and orders.

User Profiles: Allow users to update their personal information and manage multiple delivery addresses.

Order Tracking: Add functionality for users to track the status of their orders.

Shopping Cart Persistence: Beyond session, persist the cart in the database for logged-in users so it persists across different devices or sessions.

Password Security: Implement robust password hashing (e.g., BCrypt) for user passwords.

Unit & Integration Testing: Write comprehensive JUnit tests for DAO and Service layers.

Deployment: Explore deploying to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for a live, publicly accessible application.

Frontend Framework: Migrate the frontend to a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for a more scalable and component-based UI.
